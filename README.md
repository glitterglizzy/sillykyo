PHOBIAS/DiSORDERS

Scopophobia:
Scopophobia is the fear of being stared at or looked at by others. People with scopophobia may feel intense anxiety or discomfort in social situations where they believe they are being observed, leading to avoidance of such scenarios.

Podophobia:
Podophobia is the fear of feet. Individuals with podophobia may experience intense anxiety, disgust, or panic when confronted with feetâ€”whether their own or others'. This phobia can lead to avoidance of situations where feet are visible, and may interfere with daily activities, social interactions, or self-care routines involving feet.

Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder (DMDD):
Disruptive Mood Dysregulation Disorder is a childhood condition characterized by severe, recurrent temper outbursts that are out of proportion to the situation and a consistently irritable or angry mood between outbursts. These symptoms must be present for at least 12 months, occur in more than one setting (such as home and school), and are not consistent with the child's developmental level.

! TW !Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD, CSA-related):
PTSD related to childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a mental health condition that can develop after experiencing or witnessing traumatic events involving sexual abuse during childhood. Symptoms may include intrusive memories, flashbacks, nightmares, emotional numbness, heightened anxiety, difficulty trusting others, and avoidance of reminders of the trauma. PTSD from CSA can have long-lasting effects on emotional well-being, relationships, and daily functioning, and often requires specialized therapeutic support.

Social Anxiety (Online and Real Life):
Social anxiety is an intense fear or discomfort in social situations due to worry about being judged, embarrassed, or negatively evaluated by others. In real life, this can lead to avoidance of face-to-face gatherings, difficulty speaking in public, or extreme nervousness around others. Online, social anxiety may present as hesitation or dread when chatting, posting, or joining group conversations, and can cause someone to avoid digital interactions just as they might avoid in-person ones. Both forms can impact daily functioning, relationships, and self-esteem.
